# Azure WebSocket Service Architecture Diagram

1. Infrastructure

- Terraform: Provisions Azure App Service & ACR.
- Azure Container Registry (ACR): Stores the container images for deployment.
- Azure App Service: Hosts the WebSocket container for scalability and high availability.
- Scaling Rules: Configured based on active WebSocket connections.

2. Secrets Management

- Secrets Storage: Uses Azure Key Vault to securely store sensitive information.
- Authentication & Authorization: Uses JWT to secure WebSocket connections.

3. Build

- FastAPI WebSocket Server: Implements real-time communication for stock price streaming.
- Docker Container: Packages the WebSocket service for deployment.
- Container Security: Uses Trivy to scan images before deployment.

4. Deploy

- GitHub Actions: Automates the deployment pipeline.
- Trigger on Commit: Deploys the WebSocket service when code is pushed.
- Auto-Restart: Ensures service recovery on failure.
- Auto-Scaling: Scales resources dynamically based on demand.

5. Monitoring & Alerting

- Azure Monitor: Tracks application performance.
- Alerts: Detects latency spikes, WebSocket failures, and downtime.

6. Security & Compliance

- Network Security: Implements Azure Private Link / NSGs to secure WebSocket traffic.
